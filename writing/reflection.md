This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA`. I was required
to write a program that can read in a string of DNA from a previously
created inputfile. After reading in the string of DNA, I had to perform
certain procedures on said string of DNA, icluding adding, deleting
and transforming the DNA string.

The focus of the program is to help us practice using the Random class.
The real difficulty I had with the assigment is the fact that I had to add
a character to a randomly selected position in the string. After discussing
it with a colleague , I found out that the way to do this is to use a
seperate variable to designate the position for inserted character.

Another problem I ran into was the replacing procedure. After trying and
failing with the previous mentioned method, I figured out that it would be
much easier and simpler to use the "String replace" command.
